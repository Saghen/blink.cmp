# Blink Completion (blink.cmp)

**blink.cmp** is a completion plugin with support for LSPs and external sources that updates on every keystroke with minimal overhead (0.5-4ms async). It use a [custom fuzzy matcher](https://github.com/saghen/frizbee) to easily handle 20k+ items. It provides extensibility via pluggable sources (LSP, snippets, etc), component based rendering and scripting for the configuration.
