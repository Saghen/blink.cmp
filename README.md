# Blink Completion (blink.cmp)

**blink.cmp** is a completion plugin with support for LSPs and external sources that updates on every keystroke with minimal overhead (0.5-4ms async). It use a [custom SIMD fuzzy searcher](https://github.com/saghen/frizbee) to easily handle >20k items. It provides extensibility via hooks into the trigger, sources and rendering pipeline. Plenty of work has been put into making each stage of the pipeline as intelligent as possible, such as frecency and proximity bonus on fuzzy matching, and this work is on-going.
