Blink provides a sources interface, modelled after LSPs, for getting completion items, trigger characters, documentation and signature help. The `lsp`, `path`, `snippets`, `luasnip` and `buffer` sources are built-in. You may add additional [community sources](#community-sources) as well. Check out [writing sources](../development/writing-sources.md) to learn how to write your own!

## Providers

Sources are configured via the `sources.providers` table, where each `id` (`key`) must have a `name` and `module` field. The `id` (`key`) may be used in the `sources.default/per_filetype/cmdline` to enable the source.

```lua
sources = {
  default = { 'lsp' },
  providers = {
    lsp = {
      name = 'LSP',
      module = 'blink.cmp.sources.lsp',
    }
  }
}
```

### Provider options

All of the fields shown below apply to all sources. The `opts` field is passed to the source directly, and will vary by source.

```lua
sources.providers.lsp = {
  name = 'LSP',
  module = 'blink.cmp.sources.lsp',
  opts = {} -- Passed to the source directly, varies by source

  --- NOTE: All of these options may be functions to get dynamic behavior
  --- See the type definitions for more information
  enabled = true, -- Whether or not to enable the provider
  async = false, -- Whether we should wait for the provider to return before showing the completions
  timeout_ms = 2000, -- How long to wait for the provider to return before showing completions and treating it as asynchronous
  transform_items = nil, -- Function to transform the items before they're returned
  should_show_items = true, -- Whether or not to show the items
  max_items = nil, -- Maximum number of items to display in the menu
  min_keyword_length = 0, -- Minimum number of characters in the keyword to trigger the provider
  -- If this provider returns 0 items, it will fallback to these providers.
  -- If multiple providers falback to the same provider, all of the providers must return 0 items for it to fallback
  fallbacks = {},
  score_offset = 0, -- Boost/penalize the score of the items
  override = nil, -- Override the source's functions
}
```

## Using `nvim-cmp` sources

Blink can use `nvim-cmp` sources through a compatibility layer developed by [stefanboca](https://github.com/stefanboca): [blink.compat](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.compat). Please open any issues with `blink.compat` in that repo
