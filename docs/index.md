# Blink Completion (blink.cmp)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin is *beta* quality. Expect breaking changes and many bugs

**blink.cmp** is a completion plugin with support for LSPs and external sources that updates on every keystroke with minimal overhead (0.5-4ms async). It use a [custom fuzzy matcher](https://github.com/saghen/frizbee) to easily handle >20k items. It provides extensibility via pluggable sources (LSP, snippets, etc), component based rendering and scripting for the configuration.

## Features

- Works out of the box with no additional configuration
- Updates on every keystroke (0.5-4ms async, single core)
- [Typo resistant fuzzy](https://github.com/saghen/frizbee) with frecency and proximity bonus
- Extensive LSP support ([tracker](/development/lsp-tracker.md))
- [Snippet support](/configuration/snippets.html): native `vim.snippet` (including `friendly-snippets`), `LuaSnip` and `mini.snippets`
- External sources support ([community sources](/configuration/sources.html#community-sources) and [compatibility layer for `nvim-cmp` sources](https://github.com/saghen/blink.compat))
- Auto-bracket support based on semantic tokens
- Signature help (experimental, opt-in)
- Command line completion
- Terminal completion (although no source for shell completions exists yet, contributions welcome!)
- [Comparison with nvim-cmp](https://cmp.saghen.dev/#compared-to-nvim-cmp)

## Compared to nvim-cmp

- Avoids the complexity of nvim-cmp's configuration by providing sensible defaults
- Updates on every keystroke with 0.5-4ms of overhead, versus nvim-cmp's default debounce of 60ms with 2-50ms hitches from processing
  - You may try [magazine.nvim](https://github.com/iguanacucumber/magazine.nvim) which includes many performance patches, some of which have been merged into nvim-cmp
- Boosts completion item score via frecency _and_ proximity bonus. nvim-cmp boosts score via proximity bonus and optionally by recency
- Typo-resistant fuzzy matching unlike nvim-cmp's fzf-style fuzzy matching
- Core sources (buffer, snippets, path, lsp) are built-in versus nvim-cmp's exclusively external sources
- Built-in auto bracket and signature help support
- Prefetching to minimize LSP latency

### Planned missing features

- Significantly more testing
- No breaking changes
